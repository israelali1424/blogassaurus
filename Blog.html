  <h2> Day 1 </h2>
  <p id="Blog">
    Of course, I got lost on my way from the station to the google office, walking three blocks in the wrong direction before
    I realized I had to turn around.  But I was able to find my way and make in on time. The first thing I notice when walking
    into the office was the google was unlike any other company I had seen before. I was used to seeing stuffy people in suits
    who often looked too busy and hated their job. But at Google, it was 8 in the Morning and nearly every employee I saw had
    a smile on their face.The first thing we did when we got our badges was gone up to the 14th floor where most of the lessons
    will be taught. They had plenty of food as I expected ranging from bagels and cream cheese to Doritos.After a short talk,
    we did a  tour of the Google office. The office was way larger than I thought it would be; it actually takes up a whole
    city block.But if you ask me the $1.2 billion purchase Google made for the building was worth it. With mini kitchens,
    fitness centers, and even  Lego Hallways it is very easy to get lost and distracted in this building.After the tour, we
    did two awkward ice breakers and then went straight into coding. The terminal of a mac still confuses me and so I have
     study tonight. However, I really did enjoy working in HTML and CSS even though it can be a little tedious.
